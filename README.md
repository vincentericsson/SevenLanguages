Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

These are my attempts to solving the problems from the book "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Bruce A. Tate (The Pragmatic Programmers).
I can sincerely recommend this book to any serious programmer.

The code found here are for me to learn concepts from different languages, not to write beautiful code or to perfect the code. Also, much of it is porly commented. I have no intention to fix this.

If you are following along the book, please try to not look at these solutions before you have a working solution. It is the process of finding the solution that is important, not the soluution itself.

Happy programming!
